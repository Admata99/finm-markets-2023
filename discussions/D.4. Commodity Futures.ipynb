    "- **Daily Settlement**: The profit/loss of the day is settled via an accrual / deduction from the margin account. This payment is irrevocable. That is to say that it is not collateral but a permanent payment based on the day's movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variation Margin**: To reduce counterparty risk in some collateralized trades, (such as repo,) you might need to pay a variation margin when the collateral value goes down. This is a form of collateral: it earns interest on your behalf, and it will be returned at the end of the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mark-to-market**: Revising the price of an asset in the financial records, (such as a balance sheet,) to reflect the market movements in the price. This has no implications for cashflow but rather is a financial accounting revision. This term is often used to refer to teh **daily settlement** mentioned above, but this term is more general."
